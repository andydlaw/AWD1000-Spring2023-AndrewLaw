      <p>
        I am a Paramedic with a Flight Paramedic and Tactical Paramedic Certification. I enjoy
        working autonomously and have the right combination of non-traditional mentoring,
        training in clinical procedures, leadership experience, and medical knowledge to be a
        Surge Division Battalion Chief at SCCAD.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began practicing emergency medicine as a Corpsman for Marines in the Navy. I
        deployed multiple times to Iraq and Afghanistan as a non-commissioned officer
        overseeing and mentoring five to fifteen Corpsmen, maintaining the health and welfare of
        thirty to fifty Marines. As the Single Resource Paramedic on C-Shift at SCCAD, I managed
        the care of high acuity critical care transfers, developed a Clinical Practice Guideline for
        pre-hospital finger thoracotomy, and mentored new Single Resources and critical care
        paramedics. Both life experiences gave me the skills and opportunities to successfully
        lead small units to achieve high-stakes mission goals.
      </p>

      <p>The critically ill need a strong practitioner to safely transport them from point A to point B 
        while they are unstable, and traditional emergency medicine is not enough. I welcome the
        opportunity to inspire, challenge, and lead the new generation of those practitioners for
        our patients.
